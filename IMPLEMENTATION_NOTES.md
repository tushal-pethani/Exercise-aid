# Implementation Notes

This document provides a brief overview of the implementation and outstanding items for the EXERCISE AID application.

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Login/Signup with email and password
   - Role selection (client or physio)
   - User profile management

2. **Client Flow**
   - Home screen with navigation to custom tasks and assigned exercises
   - Drawer menu with profile, connections, and settings
   - Create custom task workflow with body part and exercise selection
   - Exercise configuration (sets, reps, target angle, etc.)
   - View assigned exercises from physiotherapists

3. **Physiotherapist Flow**
   - Dashboard showing client information
   - Client management interface
   - Exercise creation capability

4. **Common Features**
   - Profile management
   - Connection management between clients and physios
   - Settings screen for app preferences
   - Bluetooth device connection for exercise monitoring

## Database Models

1. **User Model**
   - Basic user information (username, email, password)
   - Role-specific fields (client/physio)
   - Settings and preferences

2. **Exercise Model**
   - Exercise configuration (body part, exercise type, sets, reps)
   - Target angles and warning thresholds
   - Relationship to creator and assignee

3. **ExerciseSession Model**
   - Performance metrics and data
   - Timestamps and completion status
   - Feedback and evaluation

## Outstanding Items

1. **Image Assets**
   - Need to add the following images to the `assets/images` directory:
     - background.jpg
     - exercise_banner.jpg
     - physio_banner.jpg
     - lateral_raise.jpg
     - bicep_curl.jpg
     - squat.jpg

2. **Backend Integration**
   - Complete integration with the server API
   - Implement data fetching and state management
   - Add error handling for network requests

3. **Bluetooth Functionality**
   - Enhance Bluetooth connectivity with angle calculation
   - Add real-time data visualization
   - Implement warnings for incorrect exercise form

4. **Further UI Polish**
   - Add loading states and animations
   - Improve responsive design for different screen sizes
   - Add accessibility features

## Implementation Strategy

The application follows a modular architecture:

1. **Navigation System**
   - Role-based navigation with drawer menu
   - Stack navigation for task flows
   - Integration between different navigation types

2. **Component Structure**
   - Separated by feature and role
   - Reusable UI components across screens
   - Context-based state management

3. **Styling System**
   - Consistent theme with defined colors, sizes, and shadows
   - Responsive layouts for different devices
   - Modern and clean UI design

## Next Steps

1. Add missing image assets
2. Implement the placeholder screens (CreateExercise, ManageClients)
3. Connect to the backend API
4. Test Bluetooth functionality with actual ESP32 devices
5. Conduct user testing and gather feedback
6. Implement additional features based on user needs

## Performance Considerations

- Image optimization for faster loading
- Memoization of components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Efficient handling of Bluetooth data streams
- Offline capability for essential functions
